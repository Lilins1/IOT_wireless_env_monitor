Write a program that consists of two processes
The first process first writes "hello, world". Thereafter, whenever triggered, the process writes "hello again, world".
The second process triggers the first process every n seconds, where n is a configurable variable
Also, add a shell command to trigger the first process from the RIOT command line.
